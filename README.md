# Octopus

## About
A tool for managing (non-fancy) local backups and syncs.

Given a directory, you can:
 - encrypt and store it in your local cloud folder (Dropbox/Google Drive/Onedrive)
 - decrypt and load content from your local cloud folder
 - back it up to an external hard drive

## Notes
Encryption is handled simply by invoking gpg.

## Current Status
The functionality described above is currently not implemented.
